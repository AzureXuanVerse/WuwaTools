# WuwaTools
A bunch of useful WuWa tools
Releasing this as Im no longer interested in WuWa RE'ing
Some of the code is 1.5+ years old, so don't expect it to be well-written

# protodumperv2.ts
- Extremely slow and unoptimized, but works just fine with full dump
# fbsdumper.ts
- Somewhat quick and efficient, outputs FlatBuffers schema for the parser
# WWParser
- Parses BinData and TextMaps from game's ConfigDB's

## For protodumperv2 and fbsdumper you need to place decompiled `Define` folder next to the scripts and run them using ts-node
